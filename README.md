# batch-image-copier
Simple tool that I wrote recently to batch copy images from one folder to another. The specific use-case was to get images from backup DVDs onto a new hard disk. Plenty of room for improvement, especially the command line options parser. That might be a nice project in itself.

There's also a bit of a reliability on WPF that I'd like to remove at some point.
